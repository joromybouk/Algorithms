Time Complexities:

Insert = O(logn)

Find = O(logn)

Delete = O(logn)

The above time complexities assume that the binary search tree is well balanced. However, due to the nature of a binary search tree, the tree at worst case form a linkedlist and therefore have a time complexity of O(n) for each operation.
