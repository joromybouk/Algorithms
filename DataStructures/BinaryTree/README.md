Time Complexities:

Insert = O(logn)

Find = O(logn)

Delete = O(logn)

The above time complexities assume that the binary search tree is well balanced. Due to the nature of a binary search tree, a linked list can be formed and therefore would mean that each operation would have a time complexity of O(n).
